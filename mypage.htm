        <h2>Projects that I am most proud of</h2>
        <p padding: 35px;>Dusian is the project of which I am most proud. 
            We are designing and prototyping a web application called Dusian for durian care as part of the SciTuHackathon competition. 
            I had the opportunity to collaborate with people with many different areas of expertise. 
            First, we gathered requirements to design a product that would help durian farmers improve the quality of their products. 
            In a short amount of time, we begin system development. 
            Thus, in addition to developing the front end of the website, 
            it is my duty to manage the team and work together to create software that will satisfy users 
            and bringing me an opportunity to pitch a funding request to the committee. 
            This project proved both my technical and emotional abilities. 
            However, it also taught me the importance of collaborative work in innovation to make an actual impact in the world.
